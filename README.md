Brain Tumor Detection model that utilizes the YoloV8 object detection model. This model has been trained on images gathered from a kaggle dataset. However, I believe the dataset's original origin is roboflow. 

In the following section charts showing the Box Loss, Class Loss and, Object Loss are provided.

The detections are not as accurate as they could be. In future iterations of this model, I aim to make the detections more accurate. I will start by trying different optimizers and move on from there.
